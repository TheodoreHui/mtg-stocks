### Pipeline


## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Directory for datasets and resources used by the project.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks:
  - **`card_comp.py`**: Script for comparing different MTG cards.
  - **`card_sim.py`**: Script for analyzing and simulating card similarities.
  - **`get_all_cards.ipynb`**: Notebook for setting up and retrieving all card data.
  - **`run.ipynb`**: Main notebook for running the project.
  - **`test.ipynb`**: Notebook for testing functionality.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).
- **`json.txt`**: A text file, likely containing configuration or raw data.

## Key Features
- **Card Comparison**: Compare attributes and features of MTG cards.
- **Card Similarity Analysis**: Analyze the similarity between cards using various metrics.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilize datasets to derive actionable insights about MTG cards.
